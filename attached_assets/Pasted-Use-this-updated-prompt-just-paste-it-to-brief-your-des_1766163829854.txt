Prompt: WebAI Automations Landing Page Redesign (with 3D Animations)

Redesign the WebAI Automations landing page in a premium B2B AI style similar to webAI.com, but make it unique to WebAI Automations with cyan branding, 3D motion, and automation‑focused messaging.

1. Overall style
Dark, minimal, enterprise SaaS look.

Black background, high‑contrast white text, cyan/blue accents.

Modern sans serif typography (Inter/Geist‑like).

Generous whitespace and clean grids.

2. Color palette
Background: #0F0F0F

Text primary: #FFFFFF

Text secondary: #CCCCCC

Text tertiary: #999999

Accent primary: #00D9FF (cyan)

Accent secondary: #0088FF (electric blue)

Accent tertiary: #7C3AED (purple for gradients)

Borders: #1A1A2E

Use cyan only for CTAs, key highlights, and a few accent words in headlines.

3. Typography
Single font family, modern sans serif:

H1: 72px desktop / 36px mobile, bold, tight letter spacing.

H2: 48px desktop / 28px mobile, bold.

H3: 24px, semibold.

Body: 16px (14px mobile), regular, line‑height 1.6.

Headlines should be short, benefit‑driven, and can have 1–2 words in cyan.

4. Layout & sections (in order)
1) Sticky navigation

Black bar, 70px height, fixed on scroll.

Left: “WebAI Automations” logo in white.

Center: links – Platform, Solutions, Customers, Resources, Company.

Right: pill “Contact Sales” button (white outline → fills on hover).

2) Hero (100vh) with 3D animation

Layout: two columns on desktop (stacked on mobile).

Left:

Optional pill badge (“Top Rated Plus - 100% Job Success”).

H1: “Automate Everything. Scale Effortlessly.”

Subheading: 2–3 lines about connecting 40+ tools, automating workflows, and scaling without hiring.

Primary CTA: cyan button “Get Started Free”.

Secondary CTA: outline button “Schedule Demo”.

Right – 3D animated focal element:

A 3D orb / cube / node graph rendered in cyan → blue → purple gradients.

Continuous, subtle motion: slow rotation, gentle floating, soft glow.

Feels like a living “automation engine”: small 3D nodes connected by glowing lines, pulses travelling along the edges to show data/automation flowing.

Motion should be smooth and light, not distracting; think 10–20% of the viewport width, high‑quality WebGL / Lottie / video loop look.

3) Trust metrics (3 KPI cards)

Three metric cards side by side:

Card 1: “3–5x ROI” – “Average return in year 1”.

Card 2: “40+ Integrations” – “Connect all your tools”.

Card 3: “500+ Companies” – “Trusted worldwide”.

Each card:

Dark card with cyan left border, large cyan number, white label, gray description.

Subtle hover effect (border glow, tiny lift).

Optionally add a very soft 3D parallax: cards shift 3–5px with mouse move.

4) Core features (3 cards)

Section title: “Core Features” or “Why WebAI Automations?”.

Three feature cards:

“Automation Studio” – build workflows visually.

“AI‑Powered Workflows” – AI that generates, routes, optimizes steps.

“Enterprise Integration” – secure connections to CRMs, ad platforms, HR, etc.

Each card:

Cyan line icon at the top.

White heading, gray copy.

Hover: cyan glow and light 3D “tilt” (subtle 3D transform on hover).

5) How it works (4‑step flow)

Horizontal flow on desktop, vertical on mobile:

Discovery & Strategy

Build & Automate

Deploy & Optimize

Scale & Support

Each step:

Cyan numbered circle, white title, gray description.

Steps connected by a cyan dashed line.

Add micro 3D motion: the numbered circles have a very light floating animation (2–3px up/down) and a soft glow.

6) Featured projects / case studies (3)

Headline: “Featured Projects”.
Subheadline: “Real results from our automation systems.”

Three large cards with:

16:9 thumbnail (can be 3D‑ish visuals of dashboards or abstract gradient landscapes).

Overlaid metric: e.g. “3x Reply Rate”, “40+ Hours Saved / Month”, “5x Lead Volume”.

Company name + 2–3 line summary.

“View Case Study” text link.

Cards should have a subtle 3D depth: layered content, box‑shadow, slightly animated gradient on hover.

7) Client logos

Heading: “Trusted by 500+ companies worldwide”.

Row/wrap of 6–8 logos:

Grayscale initially, 70% opacity.

On hover: full color, 100% opacity, tiny scale‑up.

8) Testimonials

Headline: “What Our Clients Say”.

Grid of 3–4 testimonial cards:

5 cyan stars at top.

Short quote in white.

Avatar, name, role, company in gray.

Cyan accent bar on the left of the card.

Cards can gently float 1–2px (very slow 3D depth feel) or tilt slightly on hover.

9) Final CTA

Centered section with soft dark gradient background.

H2: “Ready to Automate?”

Short supporting line (“Join 500+ companies transforming their operations with WebAI Automations.”).

Large cyan button: “Get Started Free”.

Small gray reassurance text under button (“No credit card required - 14‑day free trial”).

5. Spacing & grid
8px base grid.

Section vertical padding: 80px desktop / 40px mobile.

Max content width: 1200px, centered.

32px gaps between cards / main elements.

40px horizontal padding desktop, 16px on mobile.

6. Interaction & 3D animation rules
All 3D animations must be smooth, subtle, and lightweight.

Use them to communicate “automation engine / data flow / intelligence”, not as gimmicks.

Keep performance in mind: short loops, optimized assets, reduced motion for low‑end devices.

Provide a “reduced motion” mode where 3D effects are simplified or paused.

7. Responsive behavior
Mobile: single column, stacked sections, full‑width CTAs; hero 3D element shrinks and moves under the text.

Tablet: 2‑column where possible, navigation collapses to hamburger.

Desktop: full layout as described with 3D hero and card grids.
